# Detection Notebooks

Detection Notebooks are a collection of data science-infused Jupyter Notebooks that allow an analyst to undertake detection and threat hunting within their environment.  Notebooks are divided into targeted areas and provide background into the attack, detection method(s) and results relating to that method.
