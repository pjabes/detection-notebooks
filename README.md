# Detection Notebooks

Detection Notebooks are a collection of data science-infused Jupyter Notebooks that allow an analyst to undertake detection and threat hunting within their environment.  Notebooks are divided into a targetted area and provide background into that technology, a detection method and results relating to that method.
